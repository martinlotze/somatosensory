These Matlab scripts have been written for use on a linux machine with Freesurfer 7.1 or higher installed. The first step of the data analysis is the segmentation of brain anatomy with the Freesurfer recon-all command. After that you need to generate a directory structure as outlined in the scripts. The scripts can then be used to execute the data analysis. It is advisable to check the quality of the registration using the script having B_ as prefix. Details of the data analysis are outlined in:
